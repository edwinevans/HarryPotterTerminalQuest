Oh no! What is that? Is it a body? It looks like a girl and she isn't moving.

It's Hermione!

Her lips have turned green and there's a pot marking on her forehead. Let's look it up in the Big Book of Curses. 

Big Book of Curses
------

Curse #124: The Supus Curse - Characterized by unconsciousness and an image of a pot on the victim's forehead. The only knwn cure is to pull open the victim's eyelids and present a picture of a perfect mushroom in front of the eye lenses. A Perfect Mushroom looks like below but the top is actually half a circle:

    	    ______
	       /      \
		  |__    __|
    		 |  |
    		 |  |

    (top is half a circle)

You should look up how to draw perfectly by searching Google for "python turtle". The long lines should be 100 units long and the short ones 70 units.

This is a HARD challenge so you will need to do a lot of experimenting. You may also need to get some help from Head Wizard Smartledore. 

Good luck and remember that to rescue Herimione *** TIME IS OF THE ESSENSE ***
