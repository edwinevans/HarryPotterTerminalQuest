Do on your own:

>> Ask the user for a number. Print out the number that is double that number.

>> Ask the user for a word. If the length of the word is over 5 letters, print "That's a long word!", otherwise print "That's a short word". You can find the length of a string using the "len" function, for example: len("delicious") # returns 9
