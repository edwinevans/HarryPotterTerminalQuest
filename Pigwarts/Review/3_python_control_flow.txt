*** Compare numbers

Equal: ==
Greater: >
Greater or equal: >=
Less than: >
Less than or equal: >=

*** Check for existence of item in a collection (list/tuple/dictionary)

Item existence: "in" (Example: if apple in fruits)

*** Do something, or do something else...

if x == y:
	print "equal"
else
	print "not equal"

*** Looping

for: loop through items in a collection or range

for fruit in fruits:
	print fruit

for num in range(10): 
	print num

Use "break" to jump out of a loop

x = 0
while (True):
	if x == 10:
		break
	x = x + 1

QUESTIONS

>> How can you loop forever?

>> How can you do one thing or a different thing depending on the truth of an expression (e.g. whether the user entered "accio")

>> If you are looping forever, how can you get out of this "infinite loop"?

>> How can you loop through the numbers from 1 to 10

>> How can you loop through all the items in a list
