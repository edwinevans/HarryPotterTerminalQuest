Yay! You're through. That was much faster!

Ah, going for a walk. 

La tee da.

You 
come 
to 
a 
door. 

You try to open it but it doesn't budge. 

"Alohomora!" you shout confidently.

Nothing.

"Alohomora!" you shout even more confidently!

Nothing. "Boy this spell is really useless", you think. 

All these doors are very annoying. At least the combos only go to 100 so it isn't that bad. Right? Just 100?

Can you get it with the the absolutely FEWEST questions possible (on average)? Remember Mia, ** TIME IS OF THE ESSENCE **. 

NOTE: This is TOUGH. Here's a (big) clue to get you started. If you need to guess a number between 0 and 100 start with 50. (Why 50?). You can see 3_hints.txt for more help
