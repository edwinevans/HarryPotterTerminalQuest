Yay! You're through. That was much faster!

Ah, going for a walk. 

La tee da.

You come to a door. 

You try to open it but it doesn't budge. 

"Alohomora!" you shout confidently.

The door does nothing.

"Boy this spell is really useless", you think. 

All these doors are very annoying. At least the combos only go to 100 so it isn't that bad. Right? Just 100?

Remember Mia, ***** TIME IS OF THE ESSENCE *****. Can you do with the the absolutely FEWEST questions possible (on average)?
