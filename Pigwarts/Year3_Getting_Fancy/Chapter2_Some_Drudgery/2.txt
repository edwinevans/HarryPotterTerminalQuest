You can loop through the list like:

>>> shopping_list = ["wand", "books", "cauldren", "broomstick"]
>>> for item in shopping_list:
...     print item

Oops, we forgot to get milk.

>>> shopping_list.append("milk")
>>> shopping_list
['wand', 'books', 'cauldren', 'broomstick', 'milk']

And I'm not sure we really need a cauldren. Let's take it out of the list.
>>> shopping_list.remove("cauldren")
