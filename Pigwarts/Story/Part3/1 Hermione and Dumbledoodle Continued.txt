She said "Malfoy left the note for me thinking that I would read it and would expect him to know something about the plot. Then he could exchange his information about the dome for learning to program. He had to provide real information so as to make me feel compelled to live up to my side of the bargain. Once I knew he had spoken the truth I would teach him and he could weaponize the robotic software allowing the Death Eaters to take over Magical Britain."

"Yes" Dumbledoodle said, "It makes complete sense." Dumbledoodle's head was nodding up and down. "Truly, a brilliant scheme and it's all going according to their plan. Only Slytherins could come up with such an ingenious plan."

"Though..." Hermione said "would it not have been less risky for Malfoy to learn to program online?" Dumbledoodle said "I suppose... let's just be thankful they're only using your mind for a piece of the puzzle in their plan. If you helped them formulate their plan we'd all be doomed no doubt." 

Dumbledoodle continued "We will hold a council to plan our strategy tomorrow evening". Hermione left and Dumbledoodle went to work preparing for the meeting.
