Ginny was Ron's sister. She was shy. Her stomach would tie up in a knot when meeting new people. She was afraid to ask questions in class. She never spoke up or complained.

Until one day her Mother taught her some tricks. She made Ginny promise never to reveal any of them. The tricks worked almost too well and whenever Ginny used them she felt like an imposter. Her friends thought she was extroverted but she couldn't confide in them that she was actually shy without giving up secrets that she had promised never to reveal. 

The first secret... When the old Ginny met new people her thoughts were on how they would judge her. In some cases they *were* judging her and in some cases they were thinking about what they would have for dinner. Ginny knew this but she always felt that they were judging her and she would try to hide behind her Mother.

Her mother knew Ginny was shy. The first secret her Mother told her was to do some jujistu. If you think anyone is judging you then judge them. But judge CAREFULLY. Is the person you're meeting smiling? Is it because she is nice or because she is nervous or because she wants something? What is her situation now? What is her interest? Christians say "Judge not, lest you be judged" but Ginny would judge others. She would hunt out their differences. And when she did this she did not seem shy (although it was a lie)

The second secret... When she was in 4th grade Ginny would sit in the back of the class. When the teacher asked a question she would slink in her chair or move left or right to try to find a position where her teacher couldn't see her. Of course, this didn't work. When her teacher rooted her out she had no escape. She would answer softly and mumble a little in case she was saying something wrong. Her teacher would say "what's that Ginny? Speak up, speak up" and the kids in front of her would turn around to look. 20 students. 40 eyes. Trapped, her mind thought about how to escape but there was no escape. All she could do was throw out an answer and brace for the inevitable embarrassment of being wrong.

Her mother knew Ginny was shy. The second secret she told Ginny was to always sit near the front. The nearer you are to the front the fewer people you can see, and since you're closer you can talk more like it's a normal conversation. Ginny did this and felt guilty. She was speaking in front of a room full of people but anyone looking at this would be fooled into thinking she wasn't a shy person (although it was a lie).

The third secret... [Author comment: Unfortunately the third secret I can't reveal since I was once told the same secret and sworn to secrecy.]

The secrets also came with a warning. People who are the opposite of shy tend to have strong opinions. If other people think of you as not shy then you will express your opinions more strongly. You may hold your positions more strongly. But you must not. Your opinions must be based on your current understanding not your past, not kept just to appear consistent or not feel the pain of being wrong. You must realize that you will be drawn to your old opinions and the temptation will be invisible. The motto you should adopt is: "Strong opinions, weakly held".

Ginny remembered all this as she entered her first class at Hogwarts. She was being thrown in the deep end. It was Potions with Professor Snape. All the kids were afraid of Professor Snape. 

Ginny sat in the front. 

He looked at HER. His eyes were drilling into her.

She looked back at HIM, and this is what she saw. His head was tilted down to convey that he wouldn't accept any backtalk in his class. His eyes were slightly squinted to convey he didn't care much for children. His jaw was tight.

Why? Ginny didn't know but she would judge anyway. She would use every clue in her power to come to a beautiful conclusion -- and then look for new clues to trash it.

So she judged: he is afraid. He is afraid of the children. What can he do if they don't obey him? There is nothing he can do. "Hey Doubledoodle, Ginny is misbehaving and I don't know what to do about it. Oh, won't you help me?" He wouldn't want to do that. The only tool he has is intimidation and he is afraid it won't work. Ginny was not averting her eyes, but then she realized it was a mistake. Not because she was afraid, but because it would be silly to make an enemy of Snape for no reason. Ginny was shy but faked not being shy and now faked being shy. Oh, what a bunch of lies.

Snape began. He said, punching out each word, "My name is Professor Severus Snape and this is first year Potions class. Listen carefully everyone to this story. I have been teaching potions for 9 years and it has been the same since my first year, first year students ignorant of the power of potions and the discipline required to concoct them *correctly*. My first year teaching there was a Hufflepuff student, Roger Garrison, who did *quite well*. He listened *well* to my lectures. He helped his classmates out when they were having trouble." Snape frowned as if helping was a bad thing and then continued. "He came prepared to class." Hermione looked at Harry wondering where Snape was going with this. Snape almost shouted to get her attention "*He* was a *good* student... I gave him an A." Back to normal volume. "But he sometimes made a mistake with his measuring or the order in which he added ingredients. I considered whether to give Roger an A or B. You may not think that I, Professor Snape, in a close case like this would decide to grant an A. But I did." 

Snape paused and then continued "YOU will not get an A if you are only a *good* student. YOU will not get an A just because you listen or just because you do all your homework. YOU will not get an A just because", he sneered, "you try your... best... ".

He paused again and then continued, "Roger became an aid to Mrs Pomfrete. One day a student came in with a heart attack."

He paused again. Some of the children shifted in their chairs. "Roger mixed the ingredients for Resuscitation - wormwood, dragon lung, olive branch, seliminum flower,  migdum." He paused again to provide a gap before transitioning to the next part of his story. "Only he didn't. He forgot to put in the seliminum... Instead of Mellisa Malivendari's heart coming back to life it clamped up and no magic could save her. She was dead and still is and will be forever. Open your books to page one. Hermione! Begin reading. There will be a test tomorrow" Snape sat down and didn't say anything for the rest of the class.

Most of the kids thought it was all about trying to scare them. But of course, Ginny knew. She saw a touch of moisture in his eyes. Snape wasn't afraid he would fail to control the students. He was afraid he would fail to teach them something they needed to know. Snape's meanness was his lie.
