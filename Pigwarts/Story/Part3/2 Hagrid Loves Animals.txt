Hagrid loved all animals. Giant animals larger than houses which he felt he had a connection to being giant himself. Tiny animals smaller than his thumb which he longed to protect. Beautiful animals that inspired him, ugly animals that also inspired him. Viscous meat eaters and docile plant eaters. He loved them all.

"Ahem," Hagrid interupted "that ain't exactly righ'. I mean if they's got less than 50,000 neurons I doubt't they can 'ave a rich 'nuf concept of emotions for me t'be much sympathiz'n with'em"

Well, yes, as I was saying, Hagrid likes some animals.
