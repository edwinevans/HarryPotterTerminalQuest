The robot stood seven feet tall. It had the rough shape of a human. But it didn't have any neck. Its head was a single mold of black glass.

It had three upper appendages. Two of them were placed beneath its head and to the side like humans. They looked more like gorilla arms than human ones. These arms only had 4 fingers (including the opposable thumb). The third appendage was in front.

On its chest it had a shield with the Slytherin coat of arms and a small word below it.

Hermione could have had no way to know this but the robot's feet had wheels that could extend below like those shoes that turn into roller blades. It weighed over five hundred pounds but could jump high enough to do a backflip.  It could see in the dark using night vision, by projecting a bright large spectrum (UV to infrared light) through its head in all directions. It could see in all directions at once.

But this was no ordinary three armed, five hundred pound back-flipping robot. It had been made by purebloods, the descendants of Salazar Slitherin and it would live up to the name.

Unlike the gorilla arms that protruded from its sides, the front appendage was like the second half of a human arm (the part after the albow). The hands were very similar to a human hand including all five fingers. A right hand. It was remarkable. If it wasn't a litle shiny you couldn't even tell it wasn't a human hand. 

But Hermione didn't register any of this. She just saw a giant robot blob. Her eyes weren't drawn to its gorilla arms nor shiny head nor any part of it at all. She was transfixed by what the robot was holding in its very human hand. 

It was holding a small stick.

Dumbledore, Hermione said, I wouldn't have thought it possible but it's even worse than I thought. It's not going to be Magic versus Magic-Plus-Killer-Robots. It's Magic versus Magic-Plus-Magical-Killer-Robots!
