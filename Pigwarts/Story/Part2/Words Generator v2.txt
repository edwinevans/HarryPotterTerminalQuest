The three heros met again in the old classroom. "Where do we go from here?" Hermioned asked. They thought about it.

Harry said: 

    I had a counselor once who told me to always have a hypothesis for why
    somebody says what they say. What mental machinery generated the thoughts
    that flowed through their lips? How much processing did that machinery do
    before the words escaped?
 
    Most people mostly say whatever is going on in their heads. 
      
    Hufflepuffs always say what they are thinking.  The greatest Hufflepuffs' words 
    are but windows into their mind. You can sympathize and trust them completely. 
    Hufflepuffs say nice things because they <i>are</i> nice.

    Ravenclaws need to be right so they filter the items they aren't sure about and
    add details for the items they do know. The machinery doesn't tend to process context
    but focuses on details, thus the abundance of "Ravenclaw jokes".

    Gryffindors want to protect the world from evil. They don't exactly
    say what they are thinking. They focus on what is in their hearts and use their
    words to inspire others.

    The Hufflepuffs, Ravenclaws, and Gryffindors all freely reveal portions of their inner 
    worlds.

    But Slytherins... Slytherins always say whatever it is that they think
    will lead to their goal. When Slytherins look at the world they see idiots
    everywhere. People saying things that they are thinking instead of things
    that will help them achieve their goals. People saying things they are 
    thinking even though they will hurt their chances of achieving their goals. Slytherins
    are taught to <i>never</i> skip the step between the thoughts and words. Unlike
    Hufflepuffs the greatest Slytherins are the ones who can most perfectly
    say things different than what they are thinking. 
    
    To understand why a great Slytherin said what they said it is often more effective to 
    ignore the words. The choice of words may be three levels above anything you can figure
    out for what thoughts led to those words. For a great Slytherin it is much better to
    only look at the consequences of their words...

"Are you thinking about the note?" Hermione asked.

Ron said "Hermione received the note. Then the next day she went to Malfoy. If the person who wrote the note was Slytherin then they believed that it would help them for Hermione to go to Malfoy... but how do we even know if the writer was Slytherin?"

Hermione said "Don't you think it was a bit odd that the note said 'Um, good luck'. Why would you bother to type 'um'? This seems like the kind of thing a Hufflepuff might do just for giggles."

"Or a Slytherin pretending to be a Hufflepuff" Ron said.

Hermione said "The note was full of lies"

"The lies rule out Ravenclaw" Harry shrugged. "They're always troubling themselves with technicalities"

Hermione and Ron smiled since they knew Harry was joking. Gryffindores occasionally stretch the truth, but don't discount its nobleness.

Ron said "It wasn't signed... I think it's Slytherin." 

Hermione and Harry nodded. 

The possibility and enormity of what this meant grew larger in their minds. Slytherin was circumventing the Misuse of Muggle Artefacts decree and working to acquire muggle technology. If they succeeded and combined the power of magic with the power of technology, this would be a definitive advantage. There would be no way to resist them.

There was a few seconds of silence. Then Hermione asked, "Harry, do you really think Slytherins always formulate their words to try to achieve some selfish goal?" 

Harry said "No. When my counselor told me this I was quite young, but even then I was not so innocent as to believe that there could really be monsters. Nor was I so naive as to think there weren't many who could gain by saying as much, or many more who could be duped into believing it."
    
Hermione replied "There are many who would say you're the one who being naive if you think Slytherins aren't really monsters. You must not really know of the things they've done that are unspeakable. Things you've never seen or experienced. Perhaps you're the one who is innocent."

"The Slytherin are a tragedy." Harry said. "They have a perversion. But I believe we're all more alike than we are different... 90% of what we do is powered by natural selection, 9% is built on top of it by our parents, and 1% we build ourselves."

Hermione looked skeptical. She thought 90% may be way off, like 80% off. 

Harry continued "You'd think stopping the Slytherin would be easy given that the Sorting Hat identifies who they are. In the non-wizarding world people mostly argue over who is or is not a Slytherin. Here the Hat knows, but the Slytherins do far fewer foolish things. They are truly better individuals when judged by Slytherin standards and justified in their scorn for our incompetents. It's insane of course for Hogwarts to train the Slytherins in magic, but their lobbies always attract the smartest Slytherin graduates and the Principle of House-blind Elections is untouchable."

Hermione lookded shocked and was about to defend the principle. Then she thought better of it. She could think more about this more later. Instead she asked Harry:

    "Do you think Slytherins can change?"
    "Yes"
    "Has it ever been tried?"
    "Ten years ago some pamphlets were distributed to the Slytherin common room"
    "Did it work?"
    "I don't know. Perhaps more could be done. You know, I'm not sure we really explained the 'um' before the 'good luck'. Perhaps the note was written by a Slytherin but they have a sense of humor, a small seed of humanity that can be... exploited... for good."
    "If it comes down to it. If the choice is killing or risking defeat to give a Slytherin a chance, what should we do?" 

Nobody said anything. "It really depends on the details." Hermione stated "On the one hand people rarely change and there is so much at stake. Everything. On the other hand people deserve a chance. If there's a chance for the ultimate win we need to take it."

Harry and Ron nodded. The meeting was over.    

But once again, Hermione lingered.

    "Harry, do you say what you're thinking or say what you think will get what you want?"

Harry blurted out: 

    "I love you"

Hermione didn't know what to say. Harry said:

    "I was going to answer 'sometimes I say what I'm thinking' and then you would have said 'when?' and I would have said 'when I'm talking to somebody I trust and can be open with' and then you would have said 'do you say what you're thinking with me'? and I would have said 'I do sometimes' and you would have said 'what are you thinking now?' and I would have thought about it and said 'I love you' so I just skipped to that."

Wow. Did she love Harry? She liked him as much as any boy she knew and thought he was more special than all of them. And it would tear her apart if anything bad happened to him, but is that love?  Hermione said:

    "'Me too', I would have said"
    "Hm?"
    "If you had said 'sometimes I say what I'm thinking' I would have said 'me too'"
    "Oh"

Harry looked down. Hermione thought she could try saying someting goal oriented:

    "We don't have much time. We should help Ron with his practice"
    Harry kept his poker face and said "Yes. Agreed."
    "And Harry." Hermione said "I don't know, I think not, but maybe, I love you too"

Harry's heart leapt. It was a "think-not-but-maybe-so" love you, but he beamed as they left the room together.
