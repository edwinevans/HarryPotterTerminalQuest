Hermione walked courageously through the Slytherin commons area. A few boys and girls looked suspiciously at her. They eyed her furtively when she knocked on the door of Draco's private room, and then entered.

Draco said "Let's begin." Hermione took her backpack off her shoulder and placed it on the floor next to her legs. "Draco, this violates the Misuse of Muggle Artifacts."

"We're both well aware of that" Draco said easily.

"The law was created because our ancestors believed it could be too dangerous for individuals to be able to have so much power. I promised I would teach you but at the time I didn't consider as much as I would have if I had thought more."

"Hermione, it's not my responsibility to negotiate for you. You agreed to the deal. Let's not waste any more time. I don't accept your request to renege on your promise." He tilted his head to the laptop and said "Let's. Begin."

"Draco..." Hermione paused, willing herself to do what she had promised to herself she would. She swallowed. "I beg you. It's not a request. I'm begging to you. Please don't make me do this... Please give some thought if there is anything else you could want. I beg." She saw a flicker of sympathy cross his face. Encouraged she said "When Neville was being slapped around yesterday I saw your face. You almost intervened. You have good in you. I know you do. Please don't make me do this. Please."

"How dare you?! How. Dare You. You stupid mudblood girl! I felt nothing but scorn! Nothing! I felt only scorn for that weak miserable boy. How dare you accuse me and suggest that if I did I would admit it! How dare you, you snivelling witch, to call a Malfoy weak?!" he spat out. He stood up and put his hands on the table. "Go away! Come back tomorrow and be ready to teach... or face the consequennces." He put on his maximally menacing look which was more awful than you could imagine could be done by an 11-year-old.

Hermione knew she had lost her chance. She had lost her chance most likely forever. She thought whether if she cried, and she easily could, if he would take any pity but knew he would not. Not now. Instead she lowered her eyes, and her head, turned around and left.

Draco fumed 'How dare she? I felt only scorn. Neville was pathetic. I felt no pity. I would have slapped him. Next time I'll slap him and laugh in his face. I felt only scorn and if I didn't I certainly wouldn't be so weak as to admit it. I'm a Slythirin. Sssanazeeee sssanahisss. Saaanazeee! SaaanaZEEE!"
