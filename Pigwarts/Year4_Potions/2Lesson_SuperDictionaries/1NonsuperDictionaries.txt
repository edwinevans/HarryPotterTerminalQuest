Welcome class. You've learned lists and tuples. Today you will learn another very useful type of variable (data structure).

It's called a dictionary. Maybe you can guess why.

Here's an example:

>>> this_is_a_dictionary = { "potions":"Snape", "charms":"Flitwick", "herbology":"Sprout" }
>>> this_is_a_dictionary
{'herbology': 'Sprout', 'potions': 'Snape', 'charms': 'Flitwick'}

Here is something you can do with a dictionary:

>>> this_is_a_dictionary['charms']
'Flitwick'

>>> this_is_a_dictionary['charms'] = 'Belfry'
>>> this_is_a_dictionary
{'herbology': 'Sprout', 'potions': 'Snape', 'charms': 'Belfry'}

Try making some dictionaries in the Python interpreter and looking up values, adding values, and changing values.
