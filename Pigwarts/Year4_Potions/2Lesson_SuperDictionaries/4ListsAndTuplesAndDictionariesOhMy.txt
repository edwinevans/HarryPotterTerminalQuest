PART 1

1. Create a list of some animals

2. Create a list of tuples. Each tuple should contain the animal name and where you may find it, for example you may find a "mockingbird" in the "sky"

3. This is similar to #2 but this time use a dictionary where the keys are the animal names and the value is where you may find them. ("key/value" in dictionary is analogous to "word/definition")

4. Use the dictionary you created in #3 to find where you may see a "mockingbird"

PART 2

5. See if you can figure out how to use the list of tuples you created in #2 to find where you may find a "mockingbird".

  HINT: You can use a for loop and break out of it when you have found the right tuple

  HINT: You will need to check the first item in the tuple to see if you have found the right tuple
