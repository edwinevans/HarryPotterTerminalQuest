It may help to have some PolyJuice. I found this recipe:

Polyjuice 

Add 100 grams of Vinegar.
Add 20 grams of Fluxweed.
Add 10 grams of Knotgrass.
Add 5 grams of Lacewing.

IMPORTANT: After adding each ingreedient, wait 5 seconds.

NOTE: Here is an example of code to wait 1 second

>>> import time
>>> time.sleep(1) # delays for 1 second

Your program should output the following with a 5 second delay between each step:

Add 100 grams of Vinegar.
Add 20 grams of Fluxweed.
Add 10 grams of Knotgrass.
Add 5 grams of Lacewing.
