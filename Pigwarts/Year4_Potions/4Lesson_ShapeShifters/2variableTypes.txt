Python has five standard data types âˆ’

1. Numbers
2. String
3. List
4. Tuple
5. Dictionary

You can only do certain things with certain types

>>> varNum = 9														# Number
>>> varString = "Hello"												# String
>>> varList = ["apple", "bannana"] 									# List containing 2 Strings
>>> varTuple = ("potatoes", 3) 										# Tuple containing a String and a Number
>>> varDictionary = { "potato" : "vegetable", "orange" : "fruit" } 	# Dictionary with 2 elements

### These are OK
>>> print varNum / 3
3
>>> print varString + " there" 
Hello there

# These are not
>>> print varString / 3
HUH?? (TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for /: 'str' and 'int')

>>> print "Hello " + varNum 
HUH?? (TypeError: cannot concatenate 'str' and 'int' objects)


Variables can change types but this is not generally a good idea to do

var1 = 1 						# Hi, I'm a Number
var1 = "apple" 					# Now I'm a String!
var1 = ["apple", "bannana"] 	# Ha, fooled you, I'm a List!
