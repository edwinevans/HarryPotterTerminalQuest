OK, let's put together a bunch of stuff you have learned and create an application to create a self checkout system. This will be your fanciest program yet!

The program should allow the customer to pick from a list of items that the store sells ("worm", "unicorn horn", "stinkweed"). A customer can keep adding items until they type done. After each item it should print the total amaount so far and at the end it should print a receipt. Worms cost $0.41, Unicorn Horns cost $1000.00 and Stinkweed costs $5.00. Use a dictionary to store all the information.

Here is an example interaction.


*** Checkout: Please add your items
worm
*** Checkout: 0.41
worm
*** Checkout: 0.82
unicorn horn
*** Checkout: 1000.82
done
*** 
Your Receipt

worm - 0.41
worm - 0.41
unicorn horn - 1000
TOTAL: 1000.82

Thank you for shopping at Mia's Emporium!

Extra: If the shopper types something that is not in the dictionary print out that that item is not available and prompt the shopper to try again.
