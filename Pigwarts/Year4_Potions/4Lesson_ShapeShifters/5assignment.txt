OK, let's put together a bunch of stuff you have learned and create an application to create a self checkout system. This will be your fanciest program yet!

The program should allow the customer to pick from a list of items that the store sells ("beetle eyes", "unicorn horn", "stinkweed"). A customer can keep adding items until they type done. After each item it should print the total amaount so far and at the end it should print a receipt. Beetle eyes cost 15 Knuts a scoop, Unicorn Horns cost 10 Galleons (49300 Knuts) each and Stinkweed costs 3 Sickles per pound (87 Knuts). Use a dictionary to store all the information.

1 Galleon = 17 Sickles
1 Sickle = 29 Knuts

Here is an example interaction.


Here's what you can buy:
beetle eys - 15 Knuts
unicorn horn - 10 Galleons
Stinkweed - 3 Sickles

Thank you for shopping at Mia's Emporium!

Extra: If the shopper types something that is not in the dictionary print out that that item is not available and prompt the shopper to try again.
