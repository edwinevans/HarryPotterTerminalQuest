Remember lists?

>>> this_is_a_list = ["Aconite", "Bat blood", "Unicorn Horn"]

There is lots we can do with lists:

>>> this_is_a_list[0]
'Aconite'

>>> this_is_a_list[0] = "Boom Berry"
>>> this_is_a_list
['Boom Berry', 'Bat blood', 'Unicorn Horn']

>>> this_is_a_list.remove("Bat blood")
>>> this_is_a_list
['Boom Berry', 'Unicorn Horn']


But sometimes we want something like a list but where we don't need to change anything. In this case we can use a Tuple (pronounced Toooopuhl or 2Pull).

>>> this_is_a_tuple = ("Aconite", "Bat blood", "Unicorn Horn")
>>> this_is_a_tuple
('Aconite', 'Bat blood', 'Unicorn Horn')

Now try:
>>> this_is_a_tuple.remove(0)

Didn't work huh?

It's not much different than a list but it is generally better to use a Tuple if you don't need it to change and there are a few things you can do with Tuples that you can't with lists.

Here is another example. Notice the brackets and parenthesis. This is a LIST of TUPLES.

>>> potion_ingredients = [("Aconite", 3), ("Fairy Wing", 2), ("Unicorn Horn", 0.5)]
