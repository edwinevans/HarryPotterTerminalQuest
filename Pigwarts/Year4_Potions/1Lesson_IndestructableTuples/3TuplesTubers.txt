For today's class you're going to make Basic Mashed Potatos. First you will need to find and pay for all the ingredients. Potatoes cost $2.50, Milk costs $3.25, Butter costs $1.50.

1. Create a tuple of tuples for each ingrediant. (Hint: you may want to do this in the interpreter)

2. Loop through the tuple and print out each ingredient with its price. 

3. Then print out the total cost to buy everything.

Finally, create an alias (using Terminal) named "mashed" that will run the program you created. It should execute: python BMP.py          ^
                                                   |
                                                receipt
