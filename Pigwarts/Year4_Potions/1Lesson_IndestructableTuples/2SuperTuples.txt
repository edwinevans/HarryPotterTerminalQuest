Recall, this is what a tuple looks like:

tuple = ("dragon", "unicorn", "dog")

Tuples can also contain other tuples.

my_super_tuple = ( ("dragon", "bob"), ("unicorn", "mary"), ("dog", "rex"))

And those tuples can contain tuples:

my_super_duper_tuple = ( ("dragon", ("bob", "jones")), ("unicorn", ("mary", "smith")), ("dog", ("rex", "rover")))

You can do whatever you want:

number_tree = (50, (20, (10, 30)), 80)

Tuples have a couple other tricks up their sleave but this is plenty for your year. Next let's do a practice with Tuples (TuplesTubers) and then we will be getting close to being able to make potions!
