To keep something safe it can help to make a duplicate copy of it.

   SPELL
   ----
   cp <source> <destination>


   EXAMPLE
   ----
   cp "existing_file.txt" "copy_of_existing_file.txt"


This spell works great on books, but don't try it on a room (yet!). And unfortunately it doesn't work on Galleons or other money. Or maybe this is fortunate -- money wouldn't work very well if you could just copy it!
