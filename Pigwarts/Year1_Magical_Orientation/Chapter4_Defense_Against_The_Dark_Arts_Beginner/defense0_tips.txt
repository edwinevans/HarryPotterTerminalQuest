Hello Mia, your training is going well but you have much to learn before facing an Evil Wizard.

First you can practice battling against Minor Inconvenience when casting spells in the Terminal.

Here are some tips:

   Use tab key to complete words
   Use up/down arrows to travel through history
   Use control+a to jump to the beginning of the line
   Use control+e to jump to the end of the line

You can also use the alias that you created to show what is in the room including hidden files. Perhaps you should give it a shorter name such as "lsa"? Up to you :)

Once you master this you will be able to defeat Minor Inconvenience with nary a thought.

Give it a try.
