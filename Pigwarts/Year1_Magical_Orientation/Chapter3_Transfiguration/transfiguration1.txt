Sometimes when doing detective work it helps to appear to be something you are not.

The following spell will allow you to use other magical words to invoke the same spells you have already learned.

   SPELL
   -----
   alias

   HOW TO USE
   -----
   alias <new word> = "<existing spell>"

   EXAMPLE:
   -----
   alias read="cat"
   alias dog="cat"

Can you "dog" a file? Give it a try!

You can also just type alias to reveal all the existing aliases.
