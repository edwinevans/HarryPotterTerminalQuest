When is a book not just a book? When it is a magical diary.

The cat spell can see inside a book. Sure you can read a book, but what if you want to enter into the universe of the book? And be able to transform it? Wouldn't that be sublime?

Try using the "sublime" spell instead of "cat" and see what happens.

Example:

  sublime 2_DefeatingMoreMinorInconveniences.txt

Inside sublime, browse through the menu to see what you can do. Select "Quit Sublime Text" to leave the book universe.
