Time to get your house elf Turtle to stock the shelves at Mia's emporium!

Create some functions to draw all the items you will sell. 

The function can be named stock_shelf and have parameters for the position to start placing items, name of the item, how big it should be (in turtle units), and how many items to show. 

It could be called like: 

stock_shelf(0, 0, "wand", 100, 20) # 20 wands that are 100 units tall (You can make wands thin rectangles or something else)

You can have a separate function like:

draw_wand(20) # draw a wand that is 20 units big. position your turtle before calling

Tips:
1. You can start with the draw_wand function and test that out to get started
2. Put "import turtle" at the top and turtle.done() at the bottom
3. Search "python turtle" or such for more help on using turtle object
