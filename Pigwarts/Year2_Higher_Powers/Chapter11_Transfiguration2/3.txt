Any guess what this will do?

echo "I am a NOUN" | sed 's/NOUN/Koala/'

Try one on your own. ATTENTION, you must follow the pattern EXACTLY including a slash at the end.

Or how about

echo "I am a NOUN_1" > story.txt
sed 's/NOUN_1/Koala/' story.txt

Well, that's kind of a big clue... but this gives you some idea of the power of > and |

You can string together multiple pipes. Anything you can think to try? You can use any spell that spits out words and pipe it to anything that reads in files.
