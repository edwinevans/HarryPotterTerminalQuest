Hi Mia,

Time to get some more terminal power!

First, here's a simple new spell:

	echo

It pretty much does what it sounds like. Give it a try, like:

	echo "helloooo there"

Now for something cool. You can capture the output and put it into a magical diary using the redirect character.

Try:

	echo "Hellllo!" > mydiary.txt

> is a quick way to create books. It will overwrite anything that is there. You can use >> to add new text to the end of the book.
