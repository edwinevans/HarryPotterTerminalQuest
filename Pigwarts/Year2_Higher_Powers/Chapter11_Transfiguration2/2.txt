Now here is a really important new one that is very useful. It's called a pipe and you draw it like:

	|

This takes the output of one cammand and gives it as input to another command.

First let's learn another simple spell.

   	wc

This is Word Count. Actually it tells you number of lines, words, and characters! You can try it like this:

	wc mydiary.txt

Or instead of specifying a file you can send it input through a PIPE. For example:

   cat mydiary.txt | wc

OR

  echo "hi there" | wc

You will find this useful as you can mix all sorts of crazy things together.
