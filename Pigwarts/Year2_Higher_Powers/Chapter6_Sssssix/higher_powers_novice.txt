Now for something NEW

You have learned the basic spells, but you are a special magical girl. You can make your own spells, more powerful than anything you have seen as of yet. They are limited only by your imagination.

One way to create more advanced spells is using the python spell.

Try typing:

python snake1.py
python snake2.py

Now try making a spell that prints something out a bunch of times. This is a momentous point in your journey. Have fun!
